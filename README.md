# Python_Tools
Creating and learning about custom tools that help a process and accomplish a specific task, in Python

** Avoid making Fragile tools **

## Planning

- a tool comes from a specific need

- Keep the scope focused

- Try to keep them single-purpose tools, ie a hammer, srewdriver, wrench.

- Invlove the users, on  the "WHY" is as important as the how

## Strategy

- What options are there ?

- Automation, API, Script

- Is this reasonable to build ?

- Choose what is right for the situation

## Building a Tool

- Example #1 : Count slides in Powerpoint Decks

- input: Powerpoints decks

- ouput: Slide counts and filenames (optionally, a summary)

- Thoughts, a .pptx file is a zip file, same as a keynotes file, making a GUI with TKinter
